### Method 2 (Free Vercel)
The steps are the same as the first method, except that the fourth step is not needed.

For specific use, follow the steps  [https://github.com/apps/vercel](https://github.com/apps/vercel)



Note: If you want to deploy your own domain name, then the above tutorial is also suitable, as it provides automated deployment, and then through CNAME or Revers Proxy implementation:

  
Sample configuration for Nginx:  

```conf
# nginx

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  nav.51sec.org;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://51sec.github.io/nav/;
    }
}
```

## Bookmark import
Support importing from Chrome bookmarks (WebKit kernel should be supported~), it will automatically detect navigation that meets the three-level classification, and all others will be set as unclassified:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xjh22222228/public/gh-pages/nav/import.png)

The browser opens chrome://bookmarks/ to export the bookmarks to get the html file, and then import it from the background of the navigation website.

## Manual Edit DB.JSON File
All bookmarks are storing at db.json file. You can use JOSN Editor Online(https://jsoneditoronline.org/) to modify it manually.
